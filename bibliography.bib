abstract = {Genetic factors contribute importantly to the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), and in the past decade, there has been major progress in this area. The tools applied include genome-wide association studies encompassing {\textgreater}200 000 individuals complemented by bioinformatic approaches, including 1000 Genomes imputation, expression quantitative trait locus analyses, and interrogation of Encyclopedia of DNA Elements, Roadmap, and other data sets. close to 60 common SNPs (minor allele frequency{\textgreater}0.05) associated with CAD risk and reaching genome-wide significance (P{\textless}5×10(-8)) have been identified. Furthermore, a total of 202 independent signals in 109 loci have achieved a false discovery rate (q{\textless}0.05) and together explain 28{\%} of the estimated heritability of CAD. These data have been used successfully to create genetic risk scores that can improve risk prediction beyond conventional risk factors and identify those individuals who will benefit most from statin therapy. Such information also has important applications in clinical medicine and drug discovery by using a Mendelian randomization approach to interrogate the causal nature of many factors found to associate with CAD risk in epidemiological studies. In contrast to genome-wide association studies, whole-exome sequencing has provided valuable information directly relevant to genes with known roles in plasma lipoprotein metabolism but has, thus far, failed to identify other rare coding variants linked to CAD. Overall, recent studies have led to a broader understanding of the genetic architecture of CAD and demonstrate that it largely derives from the cumulative effect of multiple common risk alleles individually of small effect size rather than rare variants with large effects on CAD risk. Despite this success, there has been limited progress in understanding the function of the novel loci; the majority of which are in noncoding regions of the genome.},

abstract = {The past five years have seen many scientific and biological discoveries made through the experimental design of genome-wide association studies (GWASs). These studies were aimed at detecting variants at genomic loci that are associated with complex traits in the population and, in particular, at detecting associations between common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and common diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, auto-immune diseases, and psychiatric disorders. We start by giving a number of quotes from scientists and journalists about perceived problems with GWASs. We will then briefly give the history of GWASs and focus on the discoveries made through this experimental design, what those discoveries tell us and do not tell us about the genetics and biology of complex traits, and what immediate utility has come out of these studies. Rather than giving an exhaustive review of all reported findings for all diseases and other complex traits, we focus on the results for auto-immune diseases and metabolic diseases. We return to the perceived failure or disappointment about GWASs in the concluding section.},

@article{Sun2006,
abstract = {The multiplicity problem has become increasingly important in genetic studies as the capacity for high-throughput genotyping has increased. The control of False Discovery Rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg. [1995] J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B 57:289-300) has been adopted to address the problems of false positive control and low power inherent in high-volume genome-wide linkage and association studies. In many genetic studies, there is often a natural stratification of the m hypotheses to be tested. Given the FDR framework and the presence of such stratification, we investigate the performance of a stratified false discovery control approach (i.e. control or estimate FDR separately for each stratum) and compare it to the aggregated method (i.e. consider all hypotheses in a single stratum). Under the fixed rejection region framework (i.e. reject all hypotheses with unadjusted p-values less than a pre-specified level and then estimate FDR), we demonstrate that the aggregated FDR is a weighted average of the stratum-specific FDRs. Under the fixed FDR framework (i.e. reject as many hypotheses as possible and meanwhile control FDR at a pre-specified level), we specify a condition necessary for the expected total number of true positives under the stratified FDR method to be equal to or greater than that obtained from the aggregated FDR method. Application to a recent Genome-Wide Association (GWA) study by Maraganore et al. ([2005] Am. J. Hum. Genet. 77:685-693) illustrates the potential advantages of control or estimation of FDR by stratum. Our analyses also show that controlling FDR at a low rate, e.g. 5{\%} or 10{\%}, may not be feasible for some GWA studies.},

@article{Dudbridge2013,
abstract = {Polygenic scores have recently been used to summarise genetic effects among an ensemble of markers that do not individually achieve significance in a large-scale association study. Markers are selected using an initial training sample and used to construct a score in an independent replication sample by forming the weighted sum of associated alleles within each subject. Association between a trait and this composite score implies that a genetic signal is present among the selected markers, and the score can then be used for prediction of individual trait values. This approach has been used to obtain evidence of a genetic effect when no single markers are significant, to establish a common genetic basis for related disorders, and to construct risk prediction models. In some cases, however, the desired association or prediction has not been achieved. Here, the power and predictive accuracy of a polygenic score are derived from a quantitative genetics model as a function of the sizes of the two samples, explained genetic variance, selection thresholds for including a marker in the score, and methods for weighting effect sizes in the score. Expressions are derived for quantitative and discrete traits, the latter allowing for case/control sampling. A novel approach to estimating the variance explained by a marker panel is also proposed. It is shown that published studies with significant association of polygenic scores have been well powered, whereas those with negative results can be explained by low sample size. It is also shown that useful levels of prediction may only be approached when predictors are estimated from very large samples, up to an order of magnitude greater than currently available. Therefore, polygenic scores currently have more utility for association testing than predicting complex traits, but prediction will become more feasible as sample sizes continue to grow.},

@article{Euesden2014,
abstract = {SUMMARY: A polygenic risk score (PRS) is a sum of trait-associated alleles across many genetic loci, typically weighted by effect sizes estimated from a genome-wide association study. The application of PRS has grown in recent years as their utility for detecting shared genetic aetiology among traits has become appreciated; PRS can also be used to establish the presence of a genetic signal in underpowered studies, to infer the genetic architecture of a trait, for screening in clinical trials, and can act as a biomarker for a phenotype. Here we present the first dedicated PRS software, PRSice ('precise'), for calculating, applying, evaluating and plotting the results of PRS. PRSice can calculate PRS at a large number of thresholds ("high resolution") to provide the best-fit PRS, as well as provide results calculated at broad P-value thresholds, can thin Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) according to linkage disequilibrium and P-value or use all SNPs, handles genotyped and imputed data, can calculate and incorporate ancestry-informative variables, and can apply PRS across multiple traits in a single run. We exemplify the use of PRSice via application to data on schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and smoking, illustrate the importance of identifying the best-fit PRS and estimate a P-value significance threshold for high-resolution PRS studies.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PRSice is written in R, including wrappers for bash data management scripts and PLINK-1.9 to minimize computational time. PRSice runs as a command-line program with a variety of user-options, and is freely available for download from http://PRSice.info

@article{Davies2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several novel loci that reproducibly associate with CAD and/or MI risk. However, known common CAD risk variants explain only 10{\%} of the predicted genetic heritability of the disease, suggesting that important genetic signals remain to be discovered. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a discovery meta-analysis of 5 GWASs involving 13,949 subjects (7123 cases, 6826 controls) imputed at approximately 5 million SNPs using pilot 1000 Genomes based haplotypes. Promising loci were followed up in an additional 5 studies with 11,032 subjects (5211 cases, 5821 controls). A novel CAD locus on chromosome 6p21.3 in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) between HCG27 and HLA-C was identified and achieved genome wide significance in the combined analysis (rs3869109; p(discovery)=3.3×10(−7), p(replication)=5.3×10(−4) p(combined)=1.12×10(−9)). A sub-analysis combining discovery GWASs showed an attenuation of significance when stringent corrections for European population structure were employed (p=4.1×10(−10) versus 3.2×10(−7)) suggesting the observed signal is partly confounded due to population stratification. This gene dense region plays an important role in inflammation, immunity and self cell recognition. To determine whether the underlying association was driven by MHC class I alleles, we statistically imputed common HLA alleles into the discovery subjects; however, no single common HLA type contributed significantly or fully explained the observed association. CONCLUSION: We have identified a novel locus in the MHC associated with CAD. MHC genes regulate inflammation and T cell responses that contribute importantly to the initiation and propagation of atherosclerosis. Further laboratory studies will be required to understand the biological basis of this association and identify the causative allele(s). },

abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 9p21 gene dosage determines the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). Background The 9p21 locus is the first common genetic variant to associate with risk of CAD and/or myocardial infarction in multiple studies. Methods A cross-sectional study examined nondiabetic patients with CAD defined by coronary angiography to have at least 1 epicardial stenosis {\textgreater}50{\%}. In all, 950 patients with early onset CAD (age 56.1 ± 9.6 years) and an independent sample of 764 patients with late onset CAD (age 70.0 ± 8.0 years) were enrolled from the cardiac catheterization laboratories at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute from April 15, 2006, to August 15, 2008, and genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism rs1333049 9p21 risk variant. Angiographers were blinded to genotype. The association between 9p21 risk genotype and the proportion of patients with 3-vessel disease, 1-vessel disease, left main trunk disease, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery was tested, as was its association with the modified Gensini and Duke coronary scoring indexes. Results Among younger CAD cases, 3-vessel disease demonstrated a strong, direct association with 9p21 gene dosage (p = 4.26 × 10−4). Conversely, 1-vessel disease demonstrated a strong inverse association with increasing gene dosage (p = 2.41 × 10−5). In the replication sample, gene dosage also predicted 3-vessel disease (p = 6.51 × 10−6). Left main trunk disease and coronary artery bypass graft surgery demonstrated a direct strong association with gene dosage (p = 3.66 × 10−4) and (p = 2.42 × 10−2), respectively. Gene dosage demonstrated a strong, direct association with both the modified Gensini (p {\textless} 0.0001) and modified Duke (p = 3 × 10−4) coronary scores. Risk variant 9p21 did not associate with myocardial infarction once stratified for disease severity. Conclusions Gene dosage of the common risk variant 9p21 predicts the severity of coronary atheromatous burden.},

This genomic analysis identified 13 novel loci harboring one or more SNPs that were associated with CAD at P{\textless}5×10(−8) and confirmed the association of 10 of 12 previously reported CAD loci. The 13 novel loci displayed risk allele frequencies ranging from 0.13 to 0.91 and were associated with a 6 to 17 percent increase in the risk of CAD per allele.

{\textless}p{\textgreater}Large association studies have proven to be effective tools for identifying parts of the genome that influence disease risk and other heritable traits. So-called “genotype imputation” methods form a cornerstone of modern association studies: by extrapolating genetic correlations from a densely characterized reference panel to a sparsely typed study sample, such methods can estimate unobserved genotypes with high accuracy, thereby increasing the chances of finding true associations. To date, most genome-wide imputation analyses have used reference data from the International HapMap Project. While this strategy has been successful, association studies in the near future will also have access to additional reference information, such as control sets genotyped on multiple SNP chips and dense genome-wide haplotypes from the 1,000 Genomes Project. These new reference panels should improve the quality and scope of imputation, but they also present new methodological challenges. We describe a genotype imputation method, IMPUTE version 2, that is designed to address these challenges in next-generation association studies. We show that our method can use a reference panel containing thousands of chromosomes to attain higher accuracy than is possible with the HapMap alone, and that our approach is more accurate than competing methods on both current and next-generation datasets. We also highlight the modeling issues that arise in imputation datasets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

Leveraging phased haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project, we report a GWAS meta-analysis of ∼185,000 CAD cases and controls, interrogating 6.7 million common (minor allele frequency (MAF) {\textgreater} 0.05) and 2.7 million low-frequency (0.005 {\textless} MAF {\textless} 0.05) variants. In addition to confirming most known CAD-associated loci, we identified ten new loci (eight additive and two recessive) that contain candidate casual genes newly implicating biological processes in vessel walls. We observed intralocus allelic heterogeneity but little evidence of low-frequency variants with larger effects and no evidence of synthetic association. Our analysis provides a comprehensive survey of the fine genetic architecture of CAD, showing that genetic susceptibility to this common disease is largely determined by common SNPs of small effect size.},

We identify and annotate 157 loci associated with lipid levels at P {\textless} 5 [times] 10-8, including 62 loci not previously associated with lipid levels in humans. Using dense genotyping in individuals of European, East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry, we narrow association signals in 12 loci. We find that loci associated with blood lipid levels are often associated with cardiovascular and metabolic traits, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, blood pressure, waist-hip ratio and body mass index. Our results demonstrate the value of using genetic data from individuals of diverse ancestry and provide insights into the biological mechanisms regulating blood lipids to guide future genetic, biological and therapeutic research.},

abstract = {For unrelated samples, principal component (PC) analysis has been established as a simple and effective approach to adjusting for population stratification in association analysis of common variants (CVs, with minor allele frequencies MAF {\textgreater} 5{\%}). However, it is less clear how it would perform in analysis of low-frequency variants (LFVs, MAF between 1{\%} and 5{\%}), or of rare variants (RVs, MAF {\textless} 5{\%}). Furthermore, with next-generation sequencing data, it is unknown whether PCs should be constructed based on CVs, LFVs or RVs. In this study, we used the 1000 Genomes Project sequence data to explore the construction of PCs and their use in association analysis of LFVs or RVs for unrelated samples. It is shown that a few top PCs based on either CVs or LFVs could separate two continental groups, European and African samples, but those based on only RVs performed less well. When applied to several association tests in simulated data with population stratification, using PCs based on either CVs or LFVs was effective in controlling Type I error rates, while non-adjustment led to inflated Type I error rates. Perhaps the most interesting observation is that, although the PCs based on LFVs could better separate the two continental groups than those based on CVs, the use of the former could lead to over-adjustment in the sense of substantial power loss in the absence of population stratification; in contrast, we did not see any problem with the use of the PCs based on CVs in all our examples. },

We describe a method that enables explicit detection and correction of population stratification on a genome-wide scale. Our method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations.

abstract = {Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci robustly associated with plasma lipids, which also contribute to extreme lipid phenotypes. However, these common genetic variants explain less than 12{\%} of variation in lipid traits.  Adiposity is also an important determinant of plasma lipoproteins, particularly plasma triglycerides (TG) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) concentrations.  Thus, interactions between genes and clinical phenotypes may contribute to this unexplained heritability.  We have applied a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) for each of plasma TGs and HDLc in two large cohorts at the extremes of body mass index (BMI).  Both BMI and GRS were strongly associated with these lipid traits. A significant interaction between obese/lean status and GRS was noted for each of TG (PInteraction = 2.87X10-4) and HDLc (PInteraction = 1.05X10-3). These interactions were largely driven by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging APOA5, GCKR and LPL for TG, and CETP, GALNT2, LIPG and PLTP for HDLc.  In contrast, the GRSLDLc  X adiposity interaction was not significant. Sexual dimorphism was evident for the GRSHDL on HDLc in obese (PInteraction = 0.016) but not lean subjects. SNP by BMI interactions may provide biological insight into specific genetic associations and missing heritability. },

abstract = {Purpose of review: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with plasma lipid traits and have provided new insights into the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism including the identification of novel biological processes. These findings add to a body of existing data on dietary and environmental factors affecting plasma lipids. Here we explore how interactions between genetic risk factors and other phenotypes may explain some of the missing heritability of plasma lipid traits. Recent findings: Recent studies have identified true statistical interaction between several environmental and genetic risk factors and their effects on plasma lipid fractions. These include interactions between behaviors such as smoking or exercise as well as specific dietary nutrients and the effect size of specific genetic variants on plasma lipid traits risk and modifying effects of measures of adiposity on the cumulative impact of a number of common genetic variants on each of plasma triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. Summary: Interactions between genetic risk factors and clinical phenotypes may account for some of the unexplained heritability of plasma lipid traits. Recent studies provide biological insight into specific genetic associations and may aid in the identification of dyslipidemic patients for whom specific lifestyle interventions are likely to be most effective.},

abstract = {There is ongoing controversy as to whether obesity confers risk for CAD independently of associated risk factors including diabetes mellitus. We have carried out a Mendelian randomization study using a genetic risk score (GRS) for body mass index (BMI) based on 35 risk alleles to investigate this question in a population of 5831 early onset CAD cases without diabetes mellitus and 3832 elderly healthy control subjects, all of strictly European ancestry, with adjustment for traditional risk factors (TRFs). We then estimated the genetic correlation between these BMI and CAD (rg) by relating the pairwise genetic similarity matrix to a phenotypic covariance matrix between these two traits. GRSBMI significantly (P=2.12 × 10(-12)) associated with CAD status in a multivariate model adjusted for TRFs, with a per allele odds ratio (OR) of 1.06 (95{\%} CI 1.042-1.076). The addition of GRSBMI to TRFs explained 0.75{\%} of CAD variance and yielded a continuous net recombination index of 16.54{\%} (95{\%} CI=11.82-21.26{\%}, P{\textless}0.0001). To test whether GRSBMI explained CAD status when adjusted for measured BMI, separate models were constructed in which the score and BMI were either included as covariates or not. The addition of BMI explained {\~{}}1.9{\%} of CAD variance and GRSBMI plus BMI explained 2.65{\%} of CAD variance. Finally, using bivariate restricted maximum likelihood analysis, we provide strong evidence of genome-wide pleiotropy between obesity and CAD.

abstract = {SUMMARY: A polygenic risk score (PRS) is a sum of trait-associated alleles across many genetic loci, typically weighted by effect sizes estimated from a genome-wide association study. The application of PRS has grown in recent years as their utility for detecting shared genetic aetiology among traits has become appreciated; PRS can also be used to establish the presence of a genetic signal in underpowered studies, to infer the genetic architecture of a trait, for screening in clinical trials, and can act as a biomarker for a phenotype. Here we present the first dedicated PRS software, PRSice ('precise'), for calculating, applying, evaluating and plotting the results of PRS. PRSice can calculate PRS at a large number of thresholds ("high resolution") to provide the best-fit PRS, as well as provide results calculated at broad P-value thresholds, can thin Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) according to linkage disequilibrium and P-value or use all SNPs, handles genotyped and imputed data, can calculate and incorporate ancestry-informative variables, and can apply PRS across multiple traits in a single run. We exemplify the use of PRSice via application to data on schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and smoking, illustrate the importance of identifying the best-fit PRS and estimate a P-value significance threshold for high-resolution PRS studies.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PRSice is written in R, including wrappers for bash data management scripts and PLINK-1.9 to minimize computational time. PRSice runs as a command-line program with a variety of user-options, and is freely available for download from http://PRSice.info

When a test is based on an observed variable that lies on a continuous or graded scale, an assessment of the overall value of the test can be made through the use of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The curve is constructed by varying the cutpoint used to determine which values of the observed variable will be considered abnormal and then plotting the resulting sensitivities against the corresponding false positive rates. When two or more empirical curves are constructed based on tests performed on the same individuals, statistical analysis on differences between curves must take into account the correlated nature of the data.
