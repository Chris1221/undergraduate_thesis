\section*{Preface}

Throughout my undergraduate degree, I have made my fair share of mistakes. In truth, I have made many people's share of mistakes. Like the Rolling Stones, these failures have not always been what I wanted, but oftentimes they were exactly what I needed. This thesis represents the culmination of thousands of lessons taught to me by some truly incredible people.

I would first like to thank Professor Aris-Brosou for taking a chance on a Biomedical Science student first year who knew nothing about programming or statistics, without whom my life would doubtlessly be very different.

I would also like to thank Majid Nikpay, who has been a mentor to me for all of the years I have been researching statistical genetics.

Additionally, I would like to thank all of my friends for the support and motivation they have provided throughout my degree. In particular, I would thank Aaron R. Shifman. He has been a comrade in a lonely field, and a sounding board for my oftentimes less than genius ideas. 

My most heartfelt thanks goes out to my girlfriend of four years, Kennedy Hao. She has motivated me to continue on no matter the obstacle and has proven time and again to be my closest ally, no matter the battle. 

Through any and all obstacles, I have had no further to look for support than to my family. They have helped me through stress, desperation, and have been the only reason I have been able to accomplish the things that I have. Without them, nothing else would be possible.

My final acknowledgment is to my supervisor, Dr. Ruth McPherson. Working with her has been doubtlessly one of the single best decisions of my life. Three years have passed and yet Dr. McPherson continues to help me more in my career and my personal life than I could ever expect of anyone. Truly any success I may claim in the future will be a direct consequence of Dr. McPherson's kindness, generosity, and time.

To everyone, both named and not, I give my most heartfelt thanks.

%	ABSTRACT
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{abstract}

\textbf{Background and Rationale}: \ac{CAD} is a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally; much international effort has been expended to detect risk factors, both heritable and environmental. Although there is a well established genetic basis for \ac{CAD}, \acp{GWAS} have identified just 46 significantly associated common loci explaining only a small fraction (~13\%) of the predicted heritability of \ac{CAD}, estimated by twin studies to be between 40 and 60\%. \acp{PRS}, a linear combination of weighted \acp{SNP}, have been successfully used to predict \ac{CAD} with low to moderate accuracy; improvements in the methodology and implementation of these \acp{PRS} are necessary for \ac{PRS} to realize their full clinical potential.

\textbf{Purpose and Specific Objectives}: This study develops and validates two novel methodologies which integrate meta-data from co-morbid conditions to further elucidate the genetic underpinnings of \ac{CAD} while improving phenotype prediction. 

\textbf{Materials and Methods}: Three \acp{PRS} were created using summary information from several large consortia. The first \ac{TRS} model uses the typical procedure for constructing a \ac{PRS}, simply summing over all significant variants weighted by a previously identified risk score. The second risk score incorporates information from several co-morbid traits to re-prioritize the rankings of \acp{SNP} and introduce new variants into the \ac{TRS}. The third creates an optimal score which maximizes the $P$ value of association while minimizing environmental noise. These three scores are constructed, validated in a meta analysis of a population composing 5831 cases and 3832 controls, and compared mathematically in terms of their model fit and their predictive accuracy. 

\textbf{Results}: Both of our novel methodologies proved significantly better than the \ac{TRS} at predicting \ac{CAD}. Additionally, both the \ac{TRS} and the \ac{CMB} score proved superior to 1000 scores composed of equal number of \acp{SNP}, while the \ac{oPRS} did not. We additionally lend evidence to the assertion that genetic risk for high \ac{BMI} is consistent with a model where many small variants act in concert, rather than a few of larger effect size. We demonstrate the superiority of our scores and show them to be important steps forward in the development of better \ac{PRS}.

\renewcommand{\abstractname}{A note on notation}
\begin{abstract}

Throughout this thesis, the following conventions for notation are used.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A hat ($\hat{.}$) denotes the estimator of a variable (i.e. $\hat{\beta}$ is the estimator of $\beta$).
	\item Underlining a variable ($\underline{.}$) implies that it is a $n$-vector, or $n \times 1$ dimensional matrix. (i.e. $\underline{Y} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ is a $n=3$-vector).
	\item Bolding indicates a matrrix (i.e. $\mathbf{G} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \dots & 1 \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 1 & \dots & 1 \end{bmatrix}$)
\end{enumerate}
