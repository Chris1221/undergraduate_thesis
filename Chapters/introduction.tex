As the efficiency and accuracy of rapid genome sequencing skyrockets, the potential for personalized therapies has made its way from science fiction to scientific reality. Using genetics to understand, diagnose, and eventually to predict illness is not a new idea; in recent years, however, technological ability and scientific understanding have advanced to such a point that researchers may predict risk for several diseases with reasonable confidence. Increasingly, variants in the human genome are being identified as being robustly linked to risk for complex illnesses such as heart disease [\small{cite 9p21}], obesity [\small{cite fto}], and schizophrenia [\small{cite something}]. However, much work remains to be done in order to create tools which may accurately predict individual disease risk from known and unknown genetic risk factors. In this thesis, we propose a novel extension to a well known methodology in order to better characterize disease risk from comorbid conditions using only summary statistics.
